This exam was an enjoyable project. I will be coming back and working out all the bugs after you have completed your evaluation. 

How I might do things differently if I had more time:

- Spend more time on the CSS. I didn't put much time into the UI because I wanted to get the logic down first. I would have loved to get some more color and styling in there. 
- Making the components more dynamic. I would probably break down the assembly line JSX to be one smaller component repeating for each stage and removing the repeated code.
- I would like to add accessibility features such as aria labels to make this app useable for the visually impaired. 

Here is a list of what I still need to work on:
- Get the right click effect to work. The way I have in my comented out code caused the item to multiply because the event listener calls more than once.
- I was no able to get onKeyPress to work. I had the correct synax however it was not cooperating. I will be looking into why this is happeneing and how to make it work.
- The removal of the items and the Brainstorming and Deployment stage update in the state however they do not automatically update on the UI. I would fix that if I had more time.


Thank you for your time and consideration.
